Real or Fake Job Post Detection using Machine Learning.

Project Overview
This project aims to classify job postings as real or fake using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of job postings, the model can identify patterns that distinguish legitimate job listings from fraudulent ones. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of job postings, including:

Job title
Company name
Location
Job description
Requirements
Benefits
Salary
Employment type
Target variable (real or fake)
Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

Python 3.6 or above
Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook
Open the notebook Real_or_Fake_Job_Post_Detection.ipynb and run the cells step-by-step to perform data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Model Training: Using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Deployment: Saving the trained model for deployment and future predictions.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score values respectively. These results demonstrate the model's ability to effectively distinguish between real and fake job postings.

Future Work
Improving feature engineering techniques to capture more nuanced patterns in the data.
Exploring advanced models like deep learning for better performance.
Deploying the model as a web service for real-time job post classification.
